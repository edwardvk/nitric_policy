# LawPracticeZA Terms and conditions

LawPracticeZA, a product of Nitric Industries CC, is a hosted (web-based) Matter Management and Billing application, with integrated business and trust accounting, for South African law firms. Nitric Industries CC trades under the name LawPracticeZA for the purposes of providing the LawPracticeZA service/product.

The service enables you (the client) to load your client and matter details and capture accounting and billing data relating to your practice; the program processes your data and provides you with appropriate reports. The LawPracticeZA website describes the functionality provided and includes a detailed user manual as well as several training aids. The website also includes a Cost Calculator that enables you to establish the monthly subscription cost for using LawPracticeZA.

Access to LawPracticeZA is via a browser, and can be accessed using a computer, tablet or smartphone, with an internet connection.

## The important stuff

You subscribe on a monthly basis for use of the service and are assigned one or more users, each with a unique login name and password.

The main user (the Administrator) will have the ability to change users; change passwords, add users or delete users, and assign users as Fee Earners or Bookkeepers or both. The Admin user will have full access to the system, including the Bookkeeping and Fee Earner modules.
The subscription charge at the end of each month is calculated with a base cost plus a charge per each eligible user based on the price list agreed when signing up for the service. Additional users that joined the service later will be charged according to the advertised price list at the time of joining. The subscription may be subject to periodic increases not more than the prevailing inflation rate. We generally regard a user as being eligible for charging if they are a registered legal professional (attorney or advocate). We generally do not charge for support, clerical or admin staff users, however there may be exceptions to this model (for example where the service is used in an organisation which isn’t characterised as law firm) which to be negotiated and agreed on by both parties.

Your monthly subscription amount, invoiced monthly in arrears on the 25th of each month, is due for payment on presentation of our invoice, which is sent via email.
Your data is securely stored on our file servers in South Africa, as described in detail in our Privacy Policy, which can be accessed here.
You can cancel your subscription at any time via email or other written communication with one months notice. We will retain your data for up to six months before destroying it, or destroy your data at your request.

Each Subscriber shall designate an Authorized User as administrator for the Subscriber’s subscription (“Administrator”). Each Subscriber may have multiple Authorized Users, and the Administrator will manage the list of active Authorized Users associated with the subscription. The Administrator will deactivate an active Username if the Administrator wishes to terminate access to the Service for any particular user.
Subscribers are responsible for all use of the Service by Authorized Users on the list of active Authorized Users associated with their subscription to the Service.

Subscribers will implement policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized use of Usernames, and will promptly notify LawPracticeZA, upon suspicion that a Username has been lost, stolen, compromised, or misused.

## Payment, Refunds, Non-Payment, and Subscription Changes

Subscribers with paying subscriptions will receive an account on the 25th of each month for the month's subscription, depending on the number of users assigned at the end of the month, via email. They will also receive monthly statements showing invoices, receipts and credit notes.
No refunds or credits will be issued for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an active subscription.
There are no charges for cancelling a subscription, and paying subscriptions cancelled prior to the end of the current month will not be charged again in the following month or thereafter.

Should the subscription go unpaid for more than 1 month we reserve the right to publish notification messages within the LawPracticeZA application to all registered and authenticated users notifying them of possible suspension due to non-payment and we reserve the right to suspend the service with or without these warnings in the case of non-payment.
